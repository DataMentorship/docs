# Data Mentorship

## Vision

**Data Mentorship** is a program for mentoring people interested in pursuing a career in data-related jobs — Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Software Engineer, and more — in Silicon Valley. The program has a number of open source projects that are architected by mentors and developed exclusively by mentees, with support from their mentors. Each project is broken down into areas for different roles, and mentors are responsible for providing teaching material, code review and career coaching. The goal is to provide real world experience to mentees, and help them learn best practices and build a portfolio.

For example, one of the projects is building a website where users can register and receive notifications of seasonal rain forecasts on their smartphones, targeting farmers and insurance providers. One area of the project is to download the seasonal forecasts from the internet and store them in a database, and it would be done by someone interested in a data engineering career. Their mentor would orient them in learning web scraping, SQL, and how to manage databases. Another area is to implement the smartphone app and notifications, and would be taken by a person interested in mobile development.

Mentees are selected according to mentor availability, with focus on minorities and low income candidates. Mentors come from tech companies in Silicon Valley.
